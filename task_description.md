# Used Products Resale Market

Your website has to be related to selling used (second-hand products) with the ability to advertise a product.Some examples are **Buy-sell** second-hand furniture, car, bike, truck, bus, books, cooking utensils, mobile phones, headphones, laptops, laptop parts, watches, TV, exercise equipment, camera, clothes, music instruments, Fridge, A/C, etc. Remember, you will have to **choose only one types of product**. For instance, if you select furniture, then you **cannot** sell any other products, such as mobile phones, instruments, etc., other than furniture.

5. It is important to note that your UX design should be good. For example, suppose a user does not see data when they visit a route, does not see the ad after posting the advertisement without reloading the site, or gets logged out when visiting a private route right after signing up. In that case, etc., then **you may lose a significant mark for that**.

## Main Requirements

1. Y̶o̶u̶r̶ h̶o̶m̶e̶p̶a̶g̶e̶ w̶i̶l̶l̶ h̶a̶v̶e̶ a̶ *̶*̶n̶a̶v̶b̶a̶r̶*̶*̶ ,̶ a̶ b̶a̶n̶n̶e̶r̶/̶s̶l̶i̶d̶e̶r̶,̶ A̶d̶v̶e̶r̶t̶i̶s̶e̶d̶ i̶t̶e̶m̶s̶,̶  s̶e̶c̶o̶n̶d̶-̶h̶a̶n̶d̶ *̶*̶p̶r̶o̶d̶u̶c̶t̶ c̶a̶t̶e̶g̶o̶r̶i̶e̶s̶*̶*̶ s̶e̶c̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ a̶n̶d̶ a̶ r̶e̶a̶l̶i̶s̶t̶i̶c̶ *̶*̶f̶o̶o̶t̶e̶r̶*̶*̶.̶

2. Add **one** extra section on the home page. Make sure it is unique and relevant to your website.

3. **You will have to decide what would be the categories of the second-hand product you have selected.** For instance, if your website is about second-hand furniture, you can divide your categories into the bedroom, kitchen, dining room, etc.; if it is about second-hand car, your categories can be a Microbus, luxury car, electic car, etc. Or you can categorize second-hand products under brand names if you want. However, make sure it is relevant. You will need at least 3 categories, each with at least 2 products.

4. When the user clicks on a category on the home page, they will be redirected to the **/category/:id** route, where they will see **second-hand products under that category only**. The **/category/:id** page will have a column(s) of cards. It can be 1,2, or 3 columns. Each card will have a picture, name, location, resale price, original price, years of use, the time when it got posted, the seller's name; if the seller is verified, there will be a blue tick next to their name and a **Book now** button. Please note, category:/id will be a private route. 

5. On clicking the **Book now** button, a form in a modal will popup with the logged-in user name and email address, item name, and price(item name, price, and user information will not be editable) by default. You will give your phone number and meeting location, and lastly, there will be a submit button. After clicking the submit button, you will have to inform the buyer with a modal/toast that the item is booked.

7. If a user(buyer/seller/admin) is logged in, they will see **logout** (should be working) and another option on the header called Dashboard. The dashboard routes will change based on the users:

      **Buyers will see:** My orders(see bonus requirement 7),

      **Sellers will see:** Add A product (See Requirement 8), My Products(see requirement 9), My buyers(this one is optional).

8. On the " **Add A Product**" route, create a form that will have fields for product name, price, condition type(excellent, good, fair), mobile number, location (Chittagong, Dhaka, etc.), product category (every product should be under a category), description, price, Year of purchase and other relevant information. After submitting the form, a modal/toast with a message will pop up to inform the user. Please remember, they must be a seller to add a product (think about the verification process for the admin access). After adding the product, you will then be redirected to the My Products Page.

9. On the **"My Products"** page, display sales status (available or sold), price, and any other relevant information you want to show. A seller will be able to delete any of his/her product. Please note there will be a special button for each unsold/available product where the seller can hit the button to advertise. 

10. The advertised items will appear on the home page. Please note if there are no items marked as advertised, the advertised items section won't be displayed on the home page. The advertised section will only appear if there is one or more available (unsold items) are marked to be advertised.

11. " **My buyers" are optional.** See the optional section for details. On this page, a seller will see the buyer's phone, name, email address, and location.

13. On the navbar, there will be a Blogs route. This will be an open route (anyone visiting your website will see it). You will have to answer all the questions, and they are

      13.1 What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
  
      13.2 How does prototypical inheritance work?
  
      13.3 What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
  
      13.4 React vs. Angular vs. Vue?

## Bonus Requirements

1. Your Readme file for the client-side repo should have details about your project's features and functionalities in bullet points(at least five bullet points) and your live link. Adding a meaningful readme file for the server-side repo is optional.

2. At least 16 meaningful GitHub commits for the client side and 9 meaningful commits for the server-side repository. Your code should be clean and organized. Comments should be added where necessary

3̶.̶ A̶d̶d̶ a̶ m̶e̶a̶n̶i̶n̶g̶f̶u̶l̶ f̶a̶v̶i̶c̶o̶n̶.̶ If data is loading, a spinner will be displayed. When you are loading data by using a loader, make sure you have added a route.

4. Implement an extra feature: **WishList** or **Report to Admin**(choose one) in the /category/:id route. A buyer can make a product to his/her wishlist or report an item by clicking a relevant button. If you have implemented the wishlist feature, show them in the buyer's Dashboard in a separate route, "My WishList." A user should be able to purchase the item from the wishlist page. (Just redirect the user to the purchase page)

   If you have implemented the "report to admin" feature, show the reported items in the admin dashboard in a separate route, "Reported Items" (tips: create a separate collection for the wish list and filter by user email address). An admin will be able to delete a reported item. 

5. Implement the basic version of the JWT token for email/password-based authentication. Upon social login, registration, and login, you will create a JWT token and store it on the client side. You will send the token for my orders, buyers, and advertisements routes and verify the user.

6. The **all-sellers** route will have a name, email address, delete button, and verify button. Admin will be able to verify a seller. When clicked on the verify button, the seller's status will change from unverified to verified(show a blue tick when the seller is verified), and this status will be shown on the products added by a verified seller.

7. The **My Orders** route will have a table/cards. Each card/ table row will be an order having an image, title, price, and a pay button. On clicking the pay button, to take the user the payment page with fields for card details will pop up, or the user will be taken to a route where there will be a form for filling up card details. Save the payment information in the database and inform the user via a modal/toast. Don't forget to update the button text to "paid" after payment. Please note, payment will be done by Stripe. 

      Once an item is paid, it won't be displayed on the advertised item or on the category page. Only available items will be displayed to be purchased.

8. Use react query for at least two API calls.Use Axios for at least one API call

9. Most likely framework will do it for you. However do not forget to make your entire website responsive. (It is ok if the table is not responsive.) please note, all the pages including dashboard will be responsive.

10. Database collection names, routes, mongdb features/operators when needed, api naming convension and best practices.

### Optional

1. Explore [react-image-gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-gallery)and use a slider instead of a picture in your /advertisement/:id route
2. Add generic modal
